# ASHRAE III

## Next steps

- Feature engineering:
    - Reduce number of weather features and start with small feature set
    - Construct test set features and create kaggle datasets

- Settle on CV: https://www.kaggle.com/code/kyakovlev/ashrae-cv-options
    - Should splits be stratified?
    - What is the building and site distribution in each split?

- Outlier removal:

    - https://www.kaggle.com/code/gunesevitan/ashrae-lightgbm-1-048-no-leak

- EDA: For each plot add question plot tries to answer and conclusion.
